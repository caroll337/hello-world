# hello-world

Hi everybody,

I am just a newbie to Github and programming world. I purposely join here on the day GitHub got accquired. Thought it would be a great day to mark my start with programming and this interesting place. I would love to dive in this interesting and intense world and learn with everyone. 

Congratulation on the 7.5 billions accquisition! And I am so excited to know more.

Thank you.

Carol
